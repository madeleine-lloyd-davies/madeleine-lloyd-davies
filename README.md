# Howdy!

I am a comics industry professional-turned-academic administrator-turned software engineer! Proud graduate of the Grace Hopper coding bootcamp (Feb 2023).
Always excited to find opportunities to learn new things, collaborate with weirdos, do a debugging deep dive, and find ways to make someone else's life easier.

## Interests:
- **Improv**: After years of auditioning, I made it onto a UCB house time in time to do just one show before the theater shut down from COVID. That *must* be some kind of record.
- **Sewing**: I enjoy making garments and quilts. Sewing patterns are just algorithms, baby!
- **Reading**: My book club has been going strong since 2015 and is on our 67th book. Why yes, I do track them in a spreadsheet. 
- **WNBA**: L! I! B! E! R! T! Y! NEW YORK LIBERTY! Important for you to know: I am a two time winner of my WNBA fantasy draft.
