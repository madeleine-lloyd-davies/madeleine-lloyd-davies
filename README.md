# Howdy!

I am a comics industry professional-turned-academic administrator-turned software engineer! Proud graduate of the Grace Hopper coding bootcamp (Feb 2023).
Always excited to find opportunities to learn new things, collaborate with weirdos, do a debugging deep dive, and find ways to make someone else's life easier.
